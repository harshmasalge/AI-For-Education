# Personalized Micro-Learning Engine
##  Problem Statement

Build a personalized, adaptive micro-learning platform for Python programming that improves learning outcomes with minimal learner fatigue.
## Solution

We have built a  personalized Python learning platform that uses Gemini 2.5 FLASH and Gemini 2.5 PRO to adaptively assess learner competence, generate a dynamic learning path, and deliver short, interactive micro-learning exercises with instant feedback.

## Target Users

Students (Kâ€“12, undergraduates, early learners)

Self-learners and professionals seeking quick skill upgrades

## Key Features

 Smart Topic Selection â€“ Auto-chooses next module/topic based on current understanding of learner

 Micro-Learning Delivery â€“ Bite-sized lessons optimized for quick understanding

 LLM-Powered Summarization â€“ Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for context-aware content delivery

 Adaptive Learning Path â€“ Dynamically the course plan based on learner performance

 Quiz & Feedback Loop â€“ Reinforces retention and tracks mastery

## Tech Stack

Backend: Python, FastAPI

AI/LLM: Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google GenAI SDK)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Deployment: Vercel

## Business Model (B2C)

Freemium: Free access to basic modules of the course and premium subscription unlocks advanced modules

Premium Subscription: Unlocks unlimited access, progress analytics, and projects

Pay-per-course Model: One-time payment for a complete Python course with lifetime access

Add-ons: Certification modules and skill-assessment tests

## Pain Points Solved

Removes content overload

Reduces time wasted on irrelevant topics

Sustains learner motivation with bite-sized modules

Provides personalized adaptive learning instead of one-size-fits-all courses
